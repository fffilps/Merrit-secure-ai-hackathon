# AI secure vision

## Inspiration
Always wanted to make a tool using camera vision and AI. There was a suggested task to do this and grabbed our attention.
## What it does
Uses AI Datasets to identify items. Once identified, watches for changes to alert.
## How we built it
Using supervision from roboflow, python, and datasets
## Challenges we ran into
Getting the first camera to work and then getting the program to run again.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Made new connections, friends, and gained team experience
## What we learned
Its a lot harder than it seems to build an AI tool that isn't an AI wrapper, especially when using hardware.
## What's next for AI Camera Vision
Making it fully work.
